# MoneyCashBoard

##MVP

You want to start tracking your spending in an attempt to be more frugal with money.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include merchant name e.g. Tesco and value ) which has an associated Tag (e.g. ‘food’). It would then be able to track a total. Your Account could then be displayed in a view.

Suggested MVP:

- Create new transactions
- Display all transactions
- Display total expenditure
- Display total expenditure by tag

Your app could:

- CRUD actions for the transations
- Create route that sends down Account data as JSON
